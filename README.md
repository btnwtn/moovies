## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped by [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), clone this repo and run:

```
$ yarn start
```

## Supported Browsers

Because this is a technical demo I will be using `display: grid`. The app should
render correctly in most evergreen browsers.

In case you're wondering about my experience with cross-browser CSS: I've 
debugged IE11 layout bugs remotely through screenshots.
