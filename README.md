> Playing with the Movie DB API

## Getting Started

Copy `example.env` to `.env` and update the `REACT_APP_MOVIE_DB_AP_KEY` to use your own
Movie DB API key.

```
$ cp example.env .env
```

Because this project was bootstrapped by [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), you can boot up the app by running:

```
$ yarn start
```

## Supported Browsers

Because this is a technical demo I will be using `display: grid`. The app should
render correctly in most evergreen browsers.

In case you're wondering about my experience with cross-browser CSS: I've 
debugged IE11 layout bugs remotely through screenshots.
